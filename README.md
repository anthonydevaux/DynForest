## Description

`DynForest` is a R package aiming to predict an outcome using
multivariate longitudinal predictors. The method is based on random
forest principle where the longitudinal predictors are modeled through
the random forest. `DynForest` currently supports continuous,
categorical and survival outcome. The methodology is fully described for
a survival outcome in the paper:

> longitudinal endogenous covariates. *arXiv*. [\<doi:
